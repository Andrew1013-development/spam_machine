## changelog
Version 3.0 beta 5 (the newest version) :
1. Added functionality to generate 2 strings of random letters
   - Either on-demand or fixed (generate once before the spamming)
2. Added functionality for second string spamming
3. A slight change to timing (timing code integrated into the functions instead of the driver code)

Version 3.0 beta 4 (the newest version) :
1. added the ability to self-install the modules if it's missing

Version 3.0 beta 3 :
1. added more functionality for spamming 2 different messages, still in order (from string1 to string2) only
2. added Command Line Interface (CLI) test for 2 strings functionality

Version 3.0 beta 2 :
1. added basic functionality for spamming 2 different messages in order (from string1 to string2) only
   - full functionailty will come in version 3.0 beta 4 or beta 5 (read "some notices" for more details)

Version 3.0 beta 1 (the first beta of Version 3.x):
1. rewrite code to
   - Shorten code complexity / source code file size
   - Reduce CPU / memory consumption
   - Easier to run on weaker machines
2. remove time_between_message manual input, instead relying on CPU usage to determine time_between_message
3. added time for execution measurement (available in developer mode) (used for both version 2.3 and 3.0 beta 1)

Version 2.3 (newest stable version) :
1. added execution time measurement (available in development mode)

Version 2.2:
1. Fixed error : name "sus" not defined, when running version 2.1 script (observed on Python 3.10.0rc2)
2. Added "emergency stops" when CPU usage is too high to continue for 10 times

Version 2.1:
1. Added functionality to end the program in a quick manner by pressing Ctrl + C to raise up KeyboardInterrupt exception instead of pressing E, which doesn't even work well anyways
2. Added functionality to execute the spamming function in the command line interface (CLI) to preview the spam messages before moving to the main wave.

Version 2:
- Added "developer mode", which can be triggered by typing "elando" into the command line interface (CLI) while executing the .py source code file.

Version 1 to 1.2 :
Changelog lost (version 1.0 in GitHub was version 3 of the project in motion offline)
